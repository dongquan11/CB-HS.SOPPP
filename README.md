### Introduction

We study the sequential learning problems in the Colonel Blotto and Hide-and-Seek games with limited feedback, that are modeled as Path Planning Problems with Side-Observations (SOPPP). We propose an algorithm, called EXP3-OE, that solves any SOPPP and provides two main improvements in comparison with the state-of-the-art:
- (i) it runs polynomially in terms of the games' parameters, 
- (ii) it provides improved upper-bound guarantees of the expected regret.

In this work, we conducted several experiments in support of these two main novel results.
